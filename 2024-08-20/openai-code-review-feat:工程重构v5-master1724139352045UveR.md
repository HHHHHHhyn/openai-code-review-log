### Git Diff Review

#### File: `openai-code-review-sdk/src/main/java/com/yibei/infrastructure/git/GitCommand.java`

#### Changes:

The diff shows a single change in the `GitCommand` class:

1. **Return Statement Update:**
   The return statement in the `GitCommand` class has been updated to include a missing trailing slash in the file path string.

### Analysis:

- **Before Change:**
  ```java
  return githubReviewLogUri+"/blob/master"+dataFolderName+"/"+fileName;
  ```
  This line of code appends a `/blob/master` to the `githubReviewLogUri`, followed by `dataFolderName` and `fileName`. However, there is no trailing slash after `/blob/master`.

- **After Change:**
  ```java
  return githubReviewLogUri+"/blob/master/"+dataFolderName+"/"+fileName;
  ```
  The updated line now correctly adds a trailing slash after `/blob/master/`, which is necessary for constructing a valid URL.

### Recommendations:

- **Correctness:** The change is correct. The trailing slash is required to properly form the URL for accessing the file in the GitHub repository.
  
- **Testing:** It would be beneficial to ensure that the updated return statement does not affect the expected behavior of the method. This could involve adding or updating tests that check the returned URI.

- **Consistency:** The rest of the code should be reviewed to ensure that all file paths are constructed consistently and that there are no other instances where a similar issue might occur.

- **Documentation:** If the method returns a file path or URI, it might be helpful to add or update documentation to reflect the correct format of the returned string.

### Conclusion:

The change is minor and addresses a potential issue with URL construction. It is likely to be a straightforward fix that will improve the correctness of the code. However, as with any change, it is important to verify that this update does not introduce any regressions or unexpected behavior.
